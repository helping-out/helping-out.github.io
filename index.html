     <p class="paragraph">
       At this time of distress, we urbanites must come together and
       extend our support those who are not so privileged. The whole
       country is on lockdown, a majority of peopple living in slums
       are daily wage labourers who survive on their daily earnings.
       With the country on lockdown, their earning has come to a stop
       and has left them to starve. Even if they are protected from
      coronavirus, who will save them from starvation?
     </p>
     <p class="paragraph">
      It is now in our hands to come together as humans and do whatever
      we can to help those around us. As we step out of the gate of
      our complex, there are slums on both the sides, towards science
      city and mukundapur. We plan to collect funds, buy dry foods
      (dals, rice etc.) and distribute these among them.
